# US Electricity Pricing
Purpose of this effort is to unify datasets across seven different ISOs in order to track and visualize LMP trends across the United States. 

Generally, real-time ISO Energy data exists in Silos. This repository aims to walk through the process of unifying data sets for further analyis.
